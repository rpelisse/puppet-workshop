# Puppet workshop examples

This directory contains a simple puppet repository demonstrating how to:

* use 'case' statement to dynamically cope with different operating systems (AIX, RHEL)
* use stage
* use module and templates (see modules/sshd and modules/sudoers)
* create custom resource (see modules/purposes)
